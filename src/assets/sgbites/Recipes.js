    title: "ABC Juice",
    benefit: "ABC juice is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making it a nutritious and delicious choice.",
    recipe: `Wash the apples, beetroot, and carrots thoroughly. Peel the apples, beetroot, and carrots, and cut them into small slices or chunks. Removing the skin is optional but can make the juice smoother in texture. Place the apple, beetroot, and carrot slices into a blender or mixer jar. Blend the ingredients until they turn into a smooth and well-mixed juice. You can adjust the consistency by adding a little water if needed. If you prefer a sweeter taste, you can add a small amount of honey or a sweetener of your choice, but it is not necessary as the natural sugars in the fruits and vegetables should provide some sweetness. Once blended to your satisfaction, pour the juice into a glass.`,
