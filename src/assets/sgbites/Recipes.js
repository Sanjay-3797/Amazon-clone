      "Delicious Peri Peri Masala Makhana, start by dry roasting the Makhana in a pan until they turn a light golden brown, which will enhance their crunchiness. In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and add the Peri Peri Masala mix, consisting of salt, black salt, Kashmiri Red Chilli powder, Amchur Powder, Pepper Powder, Chat masala, and a pinch of hing. Stir the masala well in the hot oil to release its flavors. Then, add the dry roasted Makhana to the pan, ensuring they are evenly coated with the flavorful masala mixture. Continue to cook and stir the Makhana in the pan for a few minutes until they become well-seasoned and have a delightful Peri Peri flavor. Once done, let them cool and enjoy this spicy and tangy snack!",
